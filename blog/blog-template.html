        <b> What are the benefits of version control?</b> I've learned a lot of new information in my first week at Dev Bootcamp. Version control is an extremely important tool to use when coding. It is a system that records changes to a file over time so that you can keep track of all revisions made. It allows you to compare changes over time, see who made a revision (and why), and revert back to an earlier version before a specific change was made (perhaps due to an issue caused by the change). Basically, version control allows you to easily get back to a working version of your file if something goes wrong.

      </p>
      <p>
          <b> How does git help you keep track of changes?</b> Git is, arguably, the best version control system around. It allows programmers to make changes to files through a system called "branching" without making changes to the "master branch", which should always be fully-functional code. Git allows you to save different versions of your code every time a change is made. You can look at your "git log" to see all the changes that were "committed" (saved) and revert back to any earlier version. <br><br> Here is an example of a git log: <br><br>

      </p>
      <p>
          <b>Why use GitHub to store your code?</b> GitHub is the largest online host where you can save "git repositories" (files equipped with git version control) as well as "clone" others' repositories in order to make changes and contribute to the same files. GitHub should be used to store your code because it keeps your code in one place, safe from being lost if your computer breaks or is stolen, for example. It also allows for collaborations- once your code is on GitHub, others can work on your code with you and help debug issues you are having.

1. How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
  - It was great to have another person to come up with design ideas together.
  I struggle with design but I feel like through my practice and brainstorming with others,
  I am getting better at being more creative with my work. We, of course, have similar basic
  elements of html such as <!DOCTYPE html> and the <head> and <body> tags. A lot of the HTML
  I did on my own because I wanted to add tables for my header and footer, but I hope to find
  a better way to add a navigation bar soon.

2. Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
  - Absolutely. I do not think that I could just dive into the coding without having a framework
  of what I am trying to produce. I think I will be using wireframing for every project I work on.

3. What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
  - We decided a good wireframe should include all the elements you will want to see in the final product.
  For example, I mentioned that I'm going to be adding the navigation bar at the top of the page because
  I want my blog to be an extension of my website, where users can navigate back to the other pages
  after reading the post.

4. What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
  - I learned about <section>, <header>, and <footer>. I definitely need to practice more with
  these semantic elements but I feel like they can be really useful.

## I also wanted to mention that a lot of the styling I wanted to do, I haven't learned yet.
For example, I wanted to display the post title and date to the right of the image, rather than under.
I think next week's lessons on CSS will be extremely helpful in this aspect.
