        <h2> What is the Internet?</h2> The Internet is not a virtual cloud. It is actually a wire buried in the ground. It can be fiber optics, copper, or sometimes beamed to satellites or through cell phone networks.

       <h2> What is a server?</h2> Computers directly connected to this Internet wire are called servers, which can communicate with each other. Web pages are files on a server's hard drive. Each server has its own unique IP address that distinguishes it from other servers and is used to communicate with one another. Rather than call each server by its IP address, we use names, such as "google.com" and "aol.com".

       <h2>Are home computers servers?</h2> Personal computers are not servers, since they are not directly connected to the Internet, but they still have IP addresses. They are actually called clients that connect to the Internet through an ISP, an Internet Service Provider.

       <h2>How do home computers communicate with other home computers?</h2>In order to communicate with other home computers, like sending an email, your ISP must communicate with the server you use (for example, gmail.com), then the server will communicate with the ISP your recipient uses (for example, aol.com), which will then send your recipient your email.<br><br> PC -> SENDER ISP -> SENDER SERVER -> RECIPIENT ISP -> RECIPIENT SERVER -> RECIPIENT<br><br> Aol.com is actually both an ISP and a server, so if your recipient uses aol, these steps are combined. The information in this email is not sent all at once, rather, it is sent in small parts, called "packets". The packets are reassembled in their original order once they reach their final destination.

       <h2>What are "pieces" of the Internet?</h2>Computers, mobile devices, printers, and anything else that is connected to the Internet is considered a "piece" of the Internet. Anytime two or more pieces of the Internet intersect, there is a piece of equipment called a router, which directs packets around the Internet and helps them get to their final destination. Just visiting a single website may involve around 15 routers helping tons of packets reach your computer.
