1. What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
  * I learned that padding is the area between the content and the border, the border is the edge of the element, and the margin is the area between the border and the walls of the document, or another element. I used background colors when testing my css to get a clear picture of how these attributes affect an element, and learned that padding also increases the size of the element.

2. What did you learn about CSS positioning?
  * I learned that static postioning is the default position of an element, absolute sets that element relative to the parent element that is not static, or just to the body of the document, relative sets the element's position relative to where it would've been if it was static, and fixed keeps the position of the element in the same spot, even when scrolling. I had trouble implementing these and I need to practice more, but I've gone beyond my 4 hour timebox, so I will research these more and come back if I have time.

3. What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
  * I found it easiest to implement design elements like font size, colors, and margining my text. I found it most difficult to center my navigation bar and position my blog image and title. I spent a lot of time trying to get my blog image and title in the correct spot and eventually used a negative margin-left. I realized when you make the screen too small, the image disappears, so I know what I've done is not a permanent solution. Again, for the sake of timeboxing, I've left it like this for now and will research some more on positioning.

4. What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
  * I learned that adding and formatting with CSS allows for a lot more manipulation than simple html. It is great that you can edit certain elements for the whole document, such as fotn size, and edit very specific data using a selector, such as span.
